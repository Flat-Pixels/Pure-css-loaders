# About

This repository is a set of loaders made by using only HTML & CSS. Any javascript is used. You are free to use in your project the loader that pleases you by copying its lines of code.

# Live demo

You can see the loader already made here: 

- [https://flat-pixels.github.io/Pure-css-loaders/](https://flat-pixels.github.io/Pure-css-loaders/)

# Use a loader

To use a loader, you can download the "Build" folder and copy the html and css lines of the loader you like. Comments in both files will help you find your way.

# Add your own loader

If you want to add a loader, just make a pull request. Note that I use:

- Gulp as task manager
- Sass to write css
- [Karma style for "Git commit"](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
